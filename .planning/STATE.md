# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-24)

**Core value:** A single reliable action that disables the primary monitor (not just powers it off) and switches audio output — so games that mishandle secondary-monitor launches reliably open on the rig monitor — and just as reliably restores everything to exactly how it was before.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — monitor control (production)

## Current Position

Phase: 4
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-24 -- Phase 4 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 1 (monitor-disable spike) is sequenced first out of normal dependency order — it's the project's one unvalidated core assumption and must be answered before other work is sunk in.
- Roadmap: Coarse granularity merged research's suggested 8 phases into 5 — data/persistence merged with GUI shell (Phase 2), app control merged with audio control (Phase 3), orchestration wiring merged with packaging (Phase 5).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: RESOLVED — spike/RESULTS-TEMPLATE.md now records a GO decision (non-elevated CCD topology-path-removal confirmed working on this rig's AMD Radeon/DisplayPort hardware for a non-primary display). Remaining caveat carried into Phase 4: disabling the PRIMARY monitor specifically threw `PathChangeException` twice (Windows requires a display at (0,0); `WindowsDisplayAPI.PathInfo.Position` has no public setter to reposition the remaining display first) — a scoped, known engineering task for Phase 4, not a feasibility blocker. Fallback (pnputil/elevation) was not needed and not tested.
- Phase 4/5: Elevation requirements differ per subsystem (monitor/audio/window focus); requesting broad admin rights would break cross-process window focus on the companion app via UIPI — must default to asInvoker and confirm per-operation needs empirically. (Confirmed non-elevated for audio in Phase 3; monitor mechanism also non-elevated per Phase 1 spike.)
