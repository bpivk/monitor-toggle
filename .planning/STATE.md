# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-24)

**Core value:** A single reliable action that disables the primary monitor (not just powers it off) and switches audio output — so games that mishandle secondary-monitor launches reliably open on the rig monitor — and just as reliably restores everything to exactly how it was before.
**Current focus:** Phase 03 — app-audio-control

## Current Position

Phase: 03 (app-audio-control) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 3
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-07-24 -- Phase 03 planning complete

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Phase 1 (monitor-disable spike) is sequenced first out of normal dependency order — it's the project's one unvalidated core assumption and must be answered before other work is sunk in.
- Roadmap: Coarse granularity merged research's suggested 8 phases into 5 — data/persistence merged with GUI shell (Phase 2), app control merged with audio control (Phase 3), orchestration wiring merged with packaging (Phase 5).

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 1: No officially documented public API confirms true monitor disconnect is achievable — GPU-vendor/driver-specific behavior is unverified for the actual rig hardware; if the spike fails, the entire architecture needs re-evaluation.
- Phase 4/5: Elevation requirements differ per subsystem (monitor/audio/window focus); requesting broad admin rights would break cross-process window focus on the companion app via UIPI — must default to asInvoker and confirm per-operation needs empirically.

## Deferred Items
